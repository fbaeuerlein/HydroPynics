# HydroPynics

## Description
In 2019 i started to do some experiments with hydroponics. So i decided to do some automation to control necessary pumps and have a better overview of the environmental conditions. Finally i came up with some electrical parts to recycle to a small automation solution with a Raspberry Pi. Hopefully pictures will follow ...
To do all the communication with sensors and acquiring the data, i implemented a small python script that is reading gpios and I2C to gather all the data and finally publishes via MQTT. Currently i use Nodred for visualization and remote control.
