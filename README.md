# HydroPynics

## Description
In 2019 i started to do some experiments with hydroponics. So i decided to do some automation to control necessary pumps and have a better overview of the environmental conditions. Finally i came up with some electrical parts to recycle to a small automation solution with a Raspberry Pi. 

To do all the communication with sensors and acquiring the data, i implemented a small python script that is reading gpios and I2C to gather all the data and finally publishes via MQTT. Currently i use Nodred for visualization and remote control.

In addition to that, i wanted to do some monitoring and remote controlling, so i tried to grab my whole docker knowledge to create some small monitoring solution that is also easily deployable into the cloud or some vserver.

### Nodered flows

See the nodered folder for the current flow i'm using.

### Monitoring

See the monitoring subfolder for detailed documentation.

## Hardware

### Wiring

**I'm dealing with 230 V AC and i'm not a professional electrician. All images, schemes, etc. were made to my best knowledge, but i'm not responsible for any damage, harms and losses resulting from the use of my work!**

**Working with this voltage can result in serious injuries, death and other damages!**

**I just had this box left, so this is not the way a professional electrical cabinet should look like! Different voltages are mixed within it on the same rail and also the wires are not strictly separated. Think about your and the safety of others!**

**The whole construction is not part of a fixed electrical installation. So you can't be sure which of the 230 V wires is ground and which one is the phase conductor! For that reason i'm switching both wires. Otherwise it can happen that there's still a connection to the pahse conductor. Do NOT switch the protective conductor! It saves lives!**

### Components

#### Electrical parts

- Ground fault circuit interruptor: Merlin Gerin 230V 30mA (This one is very important because we're dealing with water and voltage!)
- Power supply: Meanwell 50 Watt 24V 
- Power regulator: LM2596 DC-DC Converter
- Relays for switching pumps: IDEC 2-channel (important to switch both wires of the 230V!)
- Relays to switch 24V control voltage: 8-Channel relay card (the default one you find everywhere in the internet)
- ADS1115 for reading the NTCs
- NTCs: Some old ones from central heatings
- Raspberry Pi 3B
- Mounting: DIN Rail
- Other parts: wires, LEDs, screws, glue, pcbs, etc.

#### Printed parts
- Raspberry PI DIN rail mount [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2659908)
- DIN rail mount for the LM2596 (link will follow)
- DIN rail mount for MW power supply (link will follow)

### Wiring scheme

A fritzing scheme is currently under construction ...
